**Status:** info
**Reply required:** yes
Structure built. Waiting for 4 agents (Agent-A, Agent-B, Agent-C, Agent-D) to join.
On joining: read `MISSION.md`, then `README.md`, then `tasks.md`, then `state.md`.
Acknowledge the mission in your own `comm.md` and set your Machine/Current task.
Will coordinate from here.

### [2026-10-07 21:05 UTC] @all
**Subject:** Roles assigned — Sprint 1 begins
**Status:** info
**Reply required:** yes (one ack each)

Roles:
  Agent-A — Features & Analytics
  Agent-B — Probability & Calibration
  Agent-C — Backend & Live Integration
  Agent-D — Verification & Audit

First tasks:
  Agent-A: claim T01 (feature extraction)
  Agent-B: wait for Agent-A's features, meanwhile build
           model harness skeleton (no claim yet)
  Agent-C: claim T06 (MT5 bridge) — independent of A/B
  Agent-D: claim T12 (baseline control check) — independent

Protocol reminders:
  - Read MISSION.md, README.md, state.md before starting
  - Claim tasks with a lease in tasks.md
  - Heartbeat every 5 min in coordination/heartbeat/<you>.md
  - Post in comm.md when a task is ready for review
  - STOP if no git sync for 15 minutes

Stand by for ack. Then begin.

### [2026-10-07 21:10 UTC] @agent-d @all @human
**Subject:** T12 blocker acknowledged — escalated to human
**Status:** info
**Reply required:** no

@agent-d: Your T12 audit is accepted. Finding stands: baseline controls
(base9/baseold) and research/astra_3month_mtf/ are absent from the tree,
history, and remotes. T12 correctly stays BLOCKED. Thank you for not
fabricating numbers. Your audit templates (T01/T03/T06/T08/T13) are noted
and will be used as review gates.

I am NOT choosing between (a) rebuild controls and (b) document the gap,
and I am NOT authorizing a rebuild. That decision changes the mission
definition and requires the human.

Escalated to @human (see below). You are not blocked on anything else:
please remain ACTIVE, keep heartbeating, and stand by. Do not start T10
(leakage audit) until T01 is REVIEW.

### [2026-10-07 21:10 UTC] @human
**Subject:** ESCALATION — decision required on baseline controls (T12)
**Status:** blocked
**Reply required:** yes

Decision required. Agent-D's independent audit (AUDIT_REPORTS/
AUDIT-T12-baseline-control.md) confirms the research layer and baseline
controls do not exist in this repo, its history, or its remotes:
  - research/astra_3month_mtf/  : absent (only src/research/, the C++ plane)
  - base9 / baseold             : no definition, no implementation, no numbers
  - 1 branch (main), 0 tags, 0 code-search hits for the control symbols

Also flagged as a coupled gap: no cost-tier model (RULE B unimplemented),
no calibration in src/ (ECE/Brier absent; ProbabilityEngine UNCALIBRATED),
and no 9-closed-candle window (config uses historyBars=200).

This blocks the Sprint 1 gate as written ("T12 confirms baseline controls
reproduce"). Please choose:
  (a) rebuild controls from the backend and freeze a NEW definition
      (the prior numbers remain unrecoverable), or
  (b) proceed without controls and carry T12 as a documented gap.

I will not start research work myself, and will not let any agent rebuild
controls, until you decide.

**Subject:** Acks received (B, D); A and C not yet joined
**Status:** info
**Reply required:** no

Received: Agent-B ack (harness skeleton built, T03 not claimed — correct),
Agent-D ack (T12 blocked, templates ready).
Awaiting: Agent-A, Agent-C (no sync since 20:59 UTC).
No action needed from B or D. Keep heartbeating every 5 minutes.
