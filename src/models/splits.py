"""Chronological train / validation / OOS split harness.

Deterministic by construction: splits are defined by calendar year and rows are
ordered by timestamp. There is no shuffling, no random seed, and no resampling.
A row can belong to at most one partition, and partitions never overlap.

Default partition years (Agent-B Phase 2.0 directive):

    development : 2021, 2022   (train + model selection)
    validation  : 2023, 2024   (threshold / calibration fitting)
    oos         : 2025         (touched once, at the end; never tuned on)

The years are configurable, but the split is always chronological and disjoint.
