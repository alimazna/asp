"""Causal, labeled dataset assembly for the model layer (T03 support).

Turns a chronological sequence of feature snapshots plus the aligned close
prices into labeled examples, then partitions them without leaking a label
window across a partition boundary.

Causality and leakage rules enforced here:
  * Features at instant i use only bars at or before i (guaranteed upstream by
    Agent-A's engine and validated by `features.py`).
  * The label uses the FUTURE price (that is the target) but is only ever read
    from the partition it belongs to. A row is PURGED from a partition when its
    label window would reach into the next partition, so no training row can be
    scored by validation/OOS information (and vice versa).
  * Everything is a pure function of the input; no shuffling, no randomness.

This module contains no modelling and publishes no probability.
