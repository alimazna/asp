"""T13 - end-to-end against the REAL backend host (not the mock).

Complements T24 (tests/integration/test_e2e_frozen_v1.py), which drives the
synthetic mock server through scripts/mock_api.py. This harness drives the
production binary build/aura_backend_host over a real loopback socket and checks
the frozen v1 contract holds on the *real* implementation:

  1. the real host answers every route in the frozen schema with HTTP 200 and a
     response that validates via Agent-B's shared T23 reader
     (src/models/contract_checker.py) - the same single frozen-set reader used by
     F17-1 and the T24 harness;
  2. RULE C / E06 / E07 hold on /analysis/latest: probability null,
     probability_calibrated false, score_is_probability false;
  3. the host is honest about its startup posture: with no staged bridge the
     system/state reports DEGRADED + shadow_only, never a false "ready".

This closes F24-1's gap (T24 only exercised the mock) at the real-host level. The
real host is NOT app-root relocatable (PathResolver derives appRootDir from the
binary's directory), so a fresh checkout starts DEGRADED - that is reported, not
hidden.

Real-data (E05) path: when ``FAKE_MT5_CSV`` points at the committed canonical M1
corpus, the harness stages the MetaTrader5 replay shim + the CSV-feed module into
the bundle, starts the real host with that feed, and asserts the *evidential*
posture: the bridge reaches the real corpus (mt5_ready, resolved symbol), every
timeframe observes real closed bars, M15 is decision-grade and the host runs in
SHADOW, while the RULE C gate stays closed (probability null) and the frozen v1
contract still holds. The default (no FAKE_MT5_CSV) run keeps the honest
no-data DEGRADED posture checks. Reads the binary; never mutates src/.

Exit 0 = the frozen v1 contract holds end to end on the real host. Skips (exit 0
with a notice) when the host has not been built in this checkout. Reads the
binary; never mutates anything.
