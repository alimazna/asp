"""T16/T17 - Frozen contract vs the real implementation.

Starts the actual backend host (build/aura_backend_host), requests every route
in the frozen contract docs/architecture/API_V1_SCHEMA.json, and validates each
live response against the schema. Also asserts the RULE C posture on this build
(the synthetic T11 audit does not authorise publication, so /analysis/latest
must report probability=null).

This is the "schema matches the implementation exactly" check the T17 freeze
requires. It reads the real binary; it never mutates anything.

Exit 0 = contract and implementation agree. Skips (exit 0 with a notice) when the
host has not been built in this checkout.
